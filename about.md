With over four years of experience at Inter, I am an iOS Engineering Specialist with a strong focus on digital security and fraud prevention. I develop solutions that protect more than 25 million users every day, building robust Swift-based features, integrating MVVM and SwiftUI architectures, and leading teams and projects to ensure a top-tier mobile experience.

My background includes implementing advanced security measures, such as liveness detection and other safeguards, all aimed at minimizing risk and fortifying our app's reliability. I view innovation as a continuous process, which motivates me to share knowledge and actively support the professional development of every team member.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to build and maintain applications for major companies across diverse industriesâ€”from retail to e-commerce and machine learning. This hands-on experience has allowed me to explore software architecture, complex integrations, continuous delivery, and agile methodologies, ensuring performance and quality in every release.

I believe security is the bedrock of any modern application. That's why I'm committed to pairing technical expertise with innovative practices, always maintaining a critical and forward-thinking outlook dedicated to constant improvement.
